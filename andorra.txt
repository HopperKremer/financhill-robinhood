Hi, I'm sorry for the confusion, we are new to renting and assumed we were automatically confirmed to move out Mar 15 becauses I was not contacted after that letter. We were not aware we would be penalized because it was not mentioned in the letter. Is there any way we could still move out on Mar 15 because we're close to deciding on a home and due to the pandemic my finances are extremely tight right now.



Dear Andorra Apartment Homes,
As follow up to your email I’d like discuss a proposal I’ve constructed considering the circumstances of COVID - 19 and the promises Andorra makes in their lease agreement. 
Section 55 of the leasing agreement (please see 'Image 2.’) fails to mention the possibility of external events outside of control of Andorra. Due to the lack of of language provided around the circumstances which exempt liability of the management, I find it would be of highest courtesy to uphold the ethical right of the community and residents by  agreeing to a proposed rebate (the rebate is further explained in the body of the note).

In addition to the lease agreement, Andorra flaunts its onsite amenities. I whole heartedly agree it is the right thing to do and accurately depicts the property; beautiful facilities, maintained with prestige and integrity to royal degrees, captivating renters and guests alike.

Between grilling areas, game room, pool, and gym, Andorra has an abundance of enticing amenities to offer. Now, with such extravagant amenities one can assume a portion of their monthly rent is applicable to the upkeep, maintenance, innovation, investment, and cleansing of said amenities. (List of amenities mentioned in image 1.)

All things considered, I’ve felt obligated to reach out on behalf of myself and the community of Andorra as someone who greatly cares for the building, property, and amenities which come from being a (timely) paying resident at the Andorra.

Here is my proposal to Andorra; this proposal should fall far from egregious considering the circumstances of todays global pandemic (Covid - 19). 

-This proposal is for residents continuously paying rent at the time of a global crisis

-Out of consideration for residents continuously generating revenue for Andorra

-A 10% rebate on invoice cost of the monthly rent deduction during the months on closed amenities

-Logic / Considerations / calculations associated with a 10% Rebate:

-Assuming each month property management delegates time, effort, and resources into the upkeep and maintenance of amenities and properties alike

-I believe the monetary value of these charges should be roughly 10% of the cost of the rent

- The economic cost of Andorra becoming exempt from their typical property maintenance on their amenities should net out positive for the residents payiong rent on time

- The above statement would mean lack of upkeep, maintenance, cleansing, investment, and innovation during the time of COVID-19 global pandemic would benefit a portion of the business Andorra conducts by decreasing the cost on the back end
- To properly calculate the rebate you would do as such: (Rent Amount in Pre - Tax $)  x   10%  x   Number of Months of missed amenities = $ Rebate for Lack of Amenities I.e. :   $2,000     x     10%.     x.      4 (March, April, May, June) = $800 


 In the hopes of appreciative and continuous partnership (resident to management) I believe a 10% rebate on missed months of amenities would be an appropriate way to show the paying residents how much they mean to the company during a time of uncertainty and unpredictability.

If there are any questions on the detailed note I’ve outlined above please reach out to me with potential times to discuss the matter at hand here. I do not want to see this go into the archives of the management email to be dismissed.
I will be available during normal business hours (9am - 5pm, M-F) to discuss in further detail. I expect to hear from your team some time this week (6/22) to further discuss this proposal. Please feel free to reach out with any questions prior to responding with a time to discuss.

Thank you,Hopper Kremer



I also wanted to inquire if there's any way we could renegotiate the rent for a couple reasons. I'm embarrassed to ask but I need some relief as my finances have not been great. I am making far less as an Uber driver and the pandemic has sullied my job search. The gym was closed for most of the year and I never felt comfortable to use the pool because of coronavirus and there was no rent adjustment. The gym was also closed for many months and after reopening I still never felt comfortable going to the gym because no one wears masks.
