# `HopTrader`: An Algotrader for TD Ameritrade and Robinhood

This is an algorithmic trading project to use <Financhill.com> to execute trades with tda-api for TD Ameritrade and robin-stocks for Robinhood. Due to recent problems with Robinhood I'm planning to focus on TD Ameritrade.

### Plan

1. Scrape top stocks listed on Financhill:
    - https://financhill.com/screen/stock-score

    or

   - https://financhill.com/lists/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-todayfinanchill

2. Buy a set amount of the top 3 stocks.

3. Check every day and sell if they are downgraded to a sell rating by searching tickers from my portfolio, for example AAPL:
