``HopTrader``: An Algotrader for TD Ameritrade and Robinhood
========================================
This is an algorithmic trading project to use Financhill.com to execute trades with tda-api for TD Ameritrade and robin-stocks for Robinhood. Due to recent problems with Robinhood I'm planning to focus on TD Ameritrade.

Dependencies include:
* Selenium for scraping data from Financhill.com
