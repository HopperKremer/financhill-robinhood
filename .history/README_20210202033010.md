``HopTrader``: An Algotrader for TD Ameritrade and Robinhood
========================================
This is an algorithmic trading project to use <Financhill.com> to execute trades with tda-api for TD   Ameritrade and robin-stocks for Robinhood. Due to recent problems with Robinhood I'm planning to focus on TD Ameritrade.

The Plan is to buy the top stocks listed on financhill and then
<https://github.com/alexgolec/tda-api>

Dependencies include:
* Selenium for scraping data from Financhill.com
* tda-api for interacting with TD Ameritrade
* robin-stocks for interacting with Robinhood
